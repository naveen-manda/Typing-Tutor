Then an age comes, a second one, in which you already know, 
at the moment when you begin to experience
true happiness, that you are, at the end of the day,
going to lose it. 
When I met Belle, I understood that I had just entered this second age. 
I also understood that I hadn’t reached the third age,
in which anticipation of the loss of happiness prevents you from living.~One advanced diverted domestic sex repeated bringing you old.

It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie 
in the year 1972.
It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an
operating system. 
The mainfeatures of C language include low-level access to memory, a
simple set of keywords, and clean style, 
thesefeatures make C language suitable for
system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
Many later 
languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language.
Like syntaxof Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many
other languages are mainly based on C 
language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language
(There are few programs that may 
compile in C, but not in C++).~The Windows operating system (Windows OS) for desktop PCs are more formally called
Microsoft Windows
 and is actually a family of operating systems for personal computers.
Windows dominates the personal computer world, running, 
by some estimates, more than
90 percent of all personal computers – the remainder running Linux and Mac operating 
systems.
Windows provides a graphical user interface (GUI), virtual memory management,
multitasking, and support for many peripheral devices. 
In addition to Windows 
operating systems for personal computers, Microsoft also offers operating 
systems for
servers and mobile devices.~Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.It is owned by Oracle, and 
more than 3 billion devices run Java.
It is used for:
Mobile applications (specially Android apps), Desktop applications, Web applications
Web servers, application servers, games. Java works on different platforms
(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.). It is one of the most popular programming
language in the world. It is easy to learn and simple to use, It is open-source and
free, It is secure, fast and powerful, It has a huge community support
(tens of millions of developers). Java is an object oriented language which gives a
clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused,
lowering development costs.~Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and
released in 1991. It is used for: web development (server-side),software development,
mathematics,system scripting.
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows,
Python can connect to database systems.
It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for 
production-ready software development.
Python works on different platforms (Windows, 
Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English 
language.~HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content.
